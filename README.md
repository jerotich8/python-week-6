# Data Analysis and Visualization Task

## Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

1. **Choose a dataset in CSV format** (e.g., Iris dataset, sales dataset, or any dataset of your choice).
2. **Load the dataset using pandas.**
3. **Display the first few rows of the dataset** using `.head()` to inspect the data.
4. **Explore the structure of the dataset** by checking the data types and any missing values.
5. **Clean the dataset** by either filling or dropping any missing values.

## Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

1. **Compute the basic statistics** of the numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) using `.describe()`.
2. **Perform groupings** on a categorical column (e.g., species, region, or department) and compute the mean of a numerical column for each group.
3. **Identify any patterns or interesting findings** from your analysis.

## Task 3: Data Visualization

1. **Create at least four different types of visualizations:**
   - Line chart showing trends over time (for example, a time-series of sales data).
   - Bar chart showing the comparison of a numerical value across categories (e.g., average petal length per species).
   - Histogram of a numerical column to understand its distribution.
   - Scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two numerical columns (e.g., sepal length vs. petal length).
2. **Customize your plots** with titles, labels for axes, and legends where necessary.
